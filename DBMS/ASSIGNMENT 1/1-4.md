1. What is SQL?

-> SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to define, retrieve, insert, update, and delete data within the database.

2. Explain several parts of SQL.

-> Several parts of SQL are:

a) Tables:
A table is a fundamental component of a relational database. It represents a collection of related data entries organized into rows and columns. Each row in a table is known as a record, and each column
represents a field or attribute of the data.

b) Queries: 
SQL allows you to retrieve specific data from one or more tables using queries.

c) Data Manipulation Language (DML):
SQL includes commands that enable users to manipulate data within tables. Common DML commands are INSERT (to add new rows), UPDATE (to modify existing rows), and DELETE (to remove rows).

d) Data Definition Language (DDL): 
DDL commands are used to define and manage the database structure and schema. This includes creating and altering database objects such as tables, views, and indexes. Common DDL commands include CREATE, ALTER,
and DROP.

e) Constraints: 
Constraints are rules applied to columns in a table to enforce data integrity. A common constraint is PRIMARY KEY (uniquely identifies each record in a table).

f) Joins: 
SQL allows you to combine data from multiple tables using joins. Joins retrieve related data based on matching values in specified columns.

g) Aggregation: 
SQL supports various aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, and MAX. These functions allow you to perform calculations on groups of data and return summarized results.

h) Subqueries: 
Subqueries are queries nested within another query. They allow you to use the result of one query as a condition or filter in another query, providing powerful and flexible data retrieval capabilities.

i) Views: 
Views are virtual tables derived from the result of a query. They enable users to simplify complex queries by encapsulating them into a reusable view, essentially acting as predefined queries.

j) Transactions: 
Transactions allow you to group one or more SQL statements into a single unit of work. They ensure that all statements within a transaction are either executed together (commit) or completely undone (rollback) 
if an error occurs, maintaining data consistency and integrity.

3. Difference between varchar (n) & varchar2 (n).

-> Difference -
   
 VARCHAR(n)                               |    VARCHAR2(n)

   a) VARCHAR is ANSI Standard                 |    VARCHAR2 is Oracle standard.
   
   b) Empty string is considered as NULL       |    Empty string is not considered as NULL
   
   c) VARCHAR(10) will hold 10 bytes of memory |    VARCHAR2(10) variable can use 2,4,5,6 etc bytes of memory if it holds smaller number of characters.

4. Difference between Desc table name & select * from table name.


-> DESC table name is used to retrieve the structure of a table (column names, data types, constraints), while SELECT * FROM table name is used to fetch all rows and columns from the specified table. The former provides metadata about the table, while the latter fetches the actual data stored in the table.
